# Getting Started

This is the theme for The Dynamics, built on top of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). To get started, you can either clone this React app and tweak it to your needs, or you can download the two files that do the styling: `tailwind.config.js`, which contains our configuration options for TailwindCSS, and `index.css`, which contains additional custom styles used by TailwindCSS through the use of `@apply` directives.
